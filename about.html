                    JavaScript Developer and future graduate of the University of Central Florida coding bootcamp. Experienced in developing web applications through JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML. Additional software development experience includes integrating JSON data from APIs using AJAX, database management utilizing Firebase, and writing various programs using C and Python.

                    I took on a leadership role in a collaborative effort to develop a web application called BrewGo, which allows users to find local breweries and restaurants. Additionally, I have developed multiple web applications which have been integrated into professional environments. While working as a public school teacher, I developed US state capital hangman and World War II trivia web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My career in public education has allowed me to develop strong organization, collaboration, and multitasking skills, all of which enable me to be a valuable and productive member of any software development team.
